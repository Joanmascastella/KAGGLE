# here have a main function that first initializes the data paths, these paths are then passed to data.py which
# returns the cleaned data in dataloaders for both train and test
# Then call the feature extraction.py to run an auto encoder which does feature extraction, this returns the
# extracted features
# after doing so pass those extracted features to the model compiler.py to run training and testing
# and return the results and loss
